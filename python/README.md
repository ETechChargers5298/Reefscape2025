This is just a brief sample of robotpy. I've rewritten our getBranchPose method in Python because we were having some trouble
compiling and running the java version with all the configurations that Java requires. Python is usually easier to run so I
thought this would be a nice way to dip our toes into Python so to speak.

To run this, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and then from the terminal run `uv run tags.py`
